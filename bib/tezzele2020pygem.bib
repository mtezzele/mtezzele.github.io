	abstract = {PyGeM is an open source Python package which allows to easily parametrize and deform 3D object described by CAD files or 3D meshes. It implements several morphing techniques such as free form deformation, radial basis function interpolation, and inverse distance weighting. Due to its versatility in dealing with different file formats it is particularly suited for researchers and practitioners both in academia and in industry interested in computational engineering simulations and optimization studies.},
